## About

#### My name is Ensar Eray Akkaya. I love designing and developing games and I work to get better.

I am studying Computer Engineering at Erciyes University for my undergraduate education. I have worked in many areas so far, I've done projects with C# ( Unity and ASP.NET Core), Node.js, C++, and Python. I have learned programming and development as a concept and with every language, I can become productive and implement projects in a short time. Apart from serious work, I have been playing the guitar for years, I love camping, alpinism and hitchhiking.
